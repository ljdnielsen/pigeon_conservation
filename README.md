# ðŸ•ŠðŸŒ¿ Pigeon Conservation

This bioinformatics project is dedicated to the conservation of pigeon species, particularly focussing on the Indo-Pacific Columbiformes. Utilizing comprehensive data analysis, detailed research notes, and innovative methods, this project aims to study and conserve pigeon populations. We employ Python and R for robust data processing and analysis, and invite collaboration and contributions from anyone interested.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview and Objectives

**Scope:** Our project undertakes a thorough assessment of publically available genetic data on Indo-Pacific Columbiformes, with a special focus on crown pigeons (genus *Goura*). We aim to understand the genetic variation and geographic distribution patterns of these species over time.

**Genomic Data Analysis:** We analyzed genomic data of four Goura species, sourced from NCBI. These datasets represent specimens collected from 1860 to the present, allowing for an exploration of the historical geographical distribution of these species. This analysis also highlights the limitations in the modern geographical sampling of DNA, impacting the assessment of changes in species diversity over time.

**Mitochondrial Genome Study:** Our study meticulously documents the origins and haplotypes of available mitochondrial genomes. Using freely availabe software, we aim to assess population diversity changes and identify areas needing enhanced sequencing efforts.

## ðŸ”ŽðŸ“Š Methodology Overview

We first used the mitochondrial genomes, sourced from NCBI, to explore the phylogenetic relationships among Indo-Pacific Columbiformes. For all Goura specimens, we systematically documented geographical origins and sampling dates. Haplotypes for each of the four Goura species were determined using R packages 'ape' and 'pegas', providing insights into their distribution and evolution.
