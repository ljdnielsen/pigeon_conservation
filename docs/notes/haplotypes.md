# Tracing Goura Haplotypes Through Time

## Median-Joining Network of Goura Cytochrome B

1. **Extraction of cytochrome b DNA sequences:**
    Cytochrome b DNA sequences were written to the FASTA file '__cytochrome_b.fasta__' with the python executable '__concatenate_genes.py__' using the terms 'CYTB' and 'cob' for input genes as the gene is annotated by either name in the genbank files:
    ~~~bash
    output_file="data/raw/genera/Goura/genes/cytb.fasta"
    > $output_file

    for file in data/raw/*.gb; do
        echo ">$(basename ${file%.gb})" >> $output_file
        python3 src/preprocessing/concatenate_genes.py --genes CYTB cob --input $file >> data/raw/genes_all/cytb.fasta
    done 
    ~~~

    The resulting FASTA file was manually assesed, and it was confirmed that each entry corresponded to the intended gene. 
    
2. **Trimming of Sequence Ends:**
    The sequences varied in length by 2 terminal bp, and were trimmed from the terminal end down to the length of the shortest sequence in the FASTA file with the script '__trim_length.py__' using the following commands:

    ~~~bash
    python3 src/preprocessing/trim_length.py --input data/raw/genera/Goura/genes/cytb.fasta --output data/processed/genera/Goura/trimmed_fasta/cytb.fasta
    ~~~
